A simple chat application that allows friends to share youtube videos, watch them at the same time, and talk about them.  

## chat.js
There is a file called chat.js that handles all the interactions between the view and the api.  In order to use it, you just need to add a few things to your html.  

### Load jquery & chat.js in your html
Since chat.js depends on Jquery, you must load jquery first.  Adding this to the `<head>` of your html should do the trick
    
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="./chat.js"></script>
